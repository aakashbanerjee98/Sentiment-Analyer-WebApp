# Sentiment Analyzer

With the advent of social media, large volumes of opinionated texts are being generated every day. Analyzing these texts can lead us to knowledge about the general sentiment of the users on a particular topic. However, if we study the available datasets for sentiment analysis, we find that the majority of them deal with either the English language or languages that have a higher digital footprint. On the other hand, sentiment datasets for Indian languages like Bengali and Hindi are scarce and hence the development of state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models for Indian languages was the main aim of this project.This is the web app version of the model which analyzes bengali sentences and shows its sentiment.
